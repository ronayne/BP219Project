This repo contains only two files: ID_cleavage_site.py and subcell_location_cytosol.tsv. 

The .py script runs the whole pipeline using the .tsv file as input. Note that the .tsv file
contains a table with quantitative and qualitative data on a subset of the human proteome that is localized in the cytosol. In brief, this pipeline involves extracting UniProt IDs from
the .tsv file, fetching FASTA amino acid sequences using these UniProt IDS, and then determining if a PLP cleavage site is present within these sequences. Subsequently, PDB files for hits 
are fetched and analyzed for solvent accessibility of residues using GetArea (see references below). Cleavage sites on the outside of the protein were defined as true PLP substrates, and 
further analyzed. A highly detailed description of all functions and code included in ID_cleavage_site.py is documented within the script itself.
